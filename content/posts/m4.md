Here is a rough plan for this project.
* Get a bunch of asset price time-series.
* Write down few discrete-time martingale models for the log-returns of these time series. Add constant dependence
  structure models to get multi-series models.
* Use the models to simulate and forecast one-day ahead price distributions.
* Construct a set of random constant-mix portfolios.
* Forecast and measure the predictive quality delivered by the models. Use these quality measures to come up with a score.
* Select good models.
* Construct risk-budgeting portfolios.

Let \\(\left( \Omega, \mathcal A, \mathcal F, P \right)\\) be a stochastic basis with a complete \\(\sigma\\)-algebra 
\\(\mathcal A\\) of measurable subsets of \\(\Omega\\), a probability measure \\(P\\), and a filtration 
\\(\mathcal{F} = (\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}\\). 
I consider discrete-time real-valued processes 
\\(X = (X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}\\), with \\(X_s \in \mathbb{R}^d\\). 

The process \\(X\\) models the evolution of log-returns of \\(d\\) asset prices observed daily. I construct \\(X\\) 
by following the usual two-step program:
1. Specify the dynamics of the one-dimensional components of \\(X\\), separately.
2. Specify the dependence model for the noise process \\(Z\\).

All models considered here have the dynamic of the form
\\[
    X_t = \sigma_t Z_t,
\\]
where \\(Z\\) is a white noise process, and the "volatility" process \\(\sigma\\) is predictable 
(i.e. \\(\sigma_t \in \mathcal{F}_{t-1}\\)).

# One-dimensional models

## M0

## M4

In the defining equation
\\[ X_t &= \sigma_t Z_t, \\]
I assume that the process \\(Z\\) is an i.i.d. Student-t noise with the degrees of freedom parameter \\(\delta\\), and
the volatility process \\(\sigma\\) satisfies
\\[
    \sigma^2_t = \gamma_0 \sum_{s<t} \left( \nu_\kappa(X) \right)_s \omega_{s-t}^0 
                + \gamma_1 \sum_{s<t} \sigma^2_s \omega^1_{s-t}.
\\]
The dynamic of \\(\sigma\\) uses a "skewed parabola" function to account for the "leverage effect" known from the
financial literature:
\\[\nu_\kappa(x) = 4 \left( (1-\kappa) x^- + \kappa x^+ \right)^2,\\]
\\[x^{-} = \min (0, x), \\] 
\\[x^+ = \max (0, x). \\]

{{< figure src="/garch/skewed_parabola.png" >}}

Note that \\(\nu_{\kappa}(x) = x^2\\) for \\(\kappa = \frac{1}{2}\\).

The exponential decay weight sequences \\(\omega^0\\) and \\(\omega^1\\) are parametrized by positive decay parameters
\\(\lambda_0\\) and \\(\lambda_1\\).
\\[
    \tilde\omega^j_i = \exp( \lambda_j i ), \ i=-1, -2, -3, \ldots, -N,
\\]
\\[
    \omega^j = \tilde\omega^j / \sum_i \tilde\omega^j_i. 
\\]
The sequence \\(\tilde\omega^j\\) vanishes for all the values of \\(i\\) other than those used in the above definition.

To summarize, the model is parametrized by the \\(6\\)-dimensional vector
\\[(\delta, \gamma_0, \gamma_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \kappa).\\]

## Noise dependence models

So far I only have constant dependence models. 

### Normal noise

### Multivariate t noise

Noise covariance estimation with decay. 

# Model selection

A: What is a good model?

B: One that is good at forecasting portfolio risk measured by CVaR.

A: But it's not obvious how to test whenever a model can forecast CVaR well.

B: That's true, but if a model can forecast the future return distributions well, then it will be able to forecast 
CVaR too.

A: How do you want to test, whether a model can forecast the future return distribution well? Using models
likelihood function seems not a very good idea, because likelihood depends on the model. And, I would like to 
compare different models, so the measure of model quality should be independent of the model construction. 

So can I measure the quality of probability measure forecast in a model-independent way?



* What are your selection criteria?
* What is your baseline model?

We have some hyperparameters! (Estimator decay factors)

# Risk stabilized portfolios (backup)

For any process $$Z = (Z_t)_{{t\in\mathbb N}}$$, we define the first difference process $$\Delta Z$$
as $$\Delta Z_0\equiv 0,$$ and $$\Delta Z_t = Z_t - Z_{t-1},$$ for $$t>0.$$

Consider an investment universe consisting of $$n$$ numeraires labeled with integers
$$1,..,n$$. We observe positive exchange rate processes

$$X_{ij} =  (X_{t,ij})_{t\in\mathbb N}$$

with $$X_{ii} \equiv 1$$. The matrix valued process $$X$$ has the property 

$$\mathbb P[X_{ij} X_{ji} \leq 1] = 1.$$

The process $$(X_{t, ij})_{t\in\mathbb N}$$ models the price of one unit of the numeraire $$i$$ in units of the 
numeraire $$j.$$

The constant vector $$h\in\mathbb R_+$$ defines the asset allocation in absolute (accounting) terms. 
The value of a portfolio described by $$h$$ in units of the numeraire $$j$$ is given by

$$V_{t,j} = (h^\top X_t)_j.$$

Adopting the accounting view has the following nice consequence:

$$\Delta V_{t} = h^\top \Delta X_t.$$

The absolute portfolio return is a linear function of the asset returns.

## Normalized exchange rates

Since absolute returns are so convenient, let's think how we can use these as often as possible. 

Let's say, at time $$t=0$$, we hold a portfolio described with the allocation vector $$h.$$
The value of this portfolio, expressed in the numeraire $$j$$ is given by 

$$V_{0, j} = (h^\top X_0)_j = h_1 X_{0, 1j} + ... + h_1 X_{0, nj}.$$

Let's construct a normalized exchange rate process $$\tilde X$$, such that the prices of all assets,
expressed in the units of the numeraire $$j$$, are given by

$$\tilde X_{t, ij} = X_{t, ij} / X_{0, ij},\ i=1,...,n.$$

This has the nice consequence, that 

$$(X_{0, 1j},...,X_{0,nj}) = (1,...,1).$$

If we set 

$$\tilde h = (h_i X_{0,ij})_{i=1,...,n},$$

then 

$$V_{0, j} = \tilde V_{0, j} = (\tilde h^\top \tilde X_{0})_j,$$

i.e. the $$j$$ value of the portfolio at time $$t=0$$ is not affected by the 
normalization. Ideally, we would like to have 

$$V = \tilde V.$$
