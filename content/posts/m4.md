Here is a rough plan for this project.
* Get a bunch of asset price time-series.
* Write down few discrete-time martingale models for the log-returns of these time series. Add constant dependence
  structure models to get multi-series models.
* Use the models to simulate and forecast one-day ahead price distributions.
* Construct a set of random constant-mix portfolios.
* Forecast and measure the predictive quality delivered by the models. Use these quality measures to come up with a score.
* Select good models.
* Construct risk-budgeting portfolios.

Let $$\left( \Omega, \mathcal A, \mathcal F, P \right)$$ be a stochastic basis with a complete $$\sigma$$-algebra 
$$\mathcal A$$ of measurable subsets of $$\Omega$$, a probability measure $$P$$, and a filtration 
$$\mathcal{F} = (\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$$. 
I consider discrete-time real-valued processes 
$$X = (X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$$, with $$X_s \in \mathbb{R}^d$$. 

The process $$X$$ models the evolution of log-returns of $$d$$ asset prices observed daily. I construct $$X$$ 
by following the usual two-step program:
1. Specify the dynamics of the one-dimensional components of $$X$$, separately.
2. Specify the dependence model for the noise process $$Z$$.

All models considered here have the dynamic of the form

$$ X_t = \sigma_t Z_t, $$

where $$Z$$ is a white noise process, and the "volatility" process $$\sigma$$ is predictable 
(i.e. $$\sigma_t \in \mathcal{F}_{t-1}$$).

# One-dimensional models

## M0

## M4

In the defining equation $$X_t = \sigma_t Z_t,$$ I assume that the process $$Z$$ is an i.i.d. Student-t noise with the degrees of freedom parameter $$\delta$$, and
the volatility process $$\sigma$$ satisfies

$$\sigma^2_t = \gamma_0 \sum_{s < t} \nu_\kappa(X)_s \omega_{s-t}^0 + \gamma_1 \sum_{s < t} \sigma^2_s \omega^1_{s-t}.$$

The dynamic of $$\sigma$$ uses a "skewed parabola" function to account for the "leverage effect" known from the
financial literature:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nu_\kappa(x) &= 4 \left( (1-\kappa) x^- + \kappa x^+ \right)^2,\\
x^{-} &= \min (0, x), \\
x^+ &= \max (0, x). 
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $$\nu_{\kappa}(x) = x^2$$ for $$\kappa = \frac{1}{2}$$.

The exponential decay weight sequences $$\omega^0$$ and $$\omega^1$$ are parametrized by positive decay parameters
$$\lambda_0$$ and $$\lambda_1$$.

$$\tilde\omega^j_i = \exp( \lambda_j i ), \ i=-1, -2, -3, \ldots, -N,$$

$$\omega^j = \tilde\omega^j / \sum_i \tilde\omega^j_i.$$

The sequence $$\tilde\omega^j$$ vanishes for all the values of $$i$$ other than those used in the above definition.

To summarize, the model is parametrized by the $$6$$-dimensional vector

$$(\delta, \gamma_0, \gamma_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \kappa).$$

## Noise dependence models

So far I only have constant dependence models. 

### Normal noise

### Multivariate t noise

Noise covariance estimation with decay. 

# Model selection

A: What is a good model?

B: One that is good at forecasting portfolio risk measured by CVaR.

A: But it's not obvious how to test whenever a model can forecast CVaR well.

B: That's true, but if a model can forecast the future return distributions well, then it will be able to forecast 
CVaR too.

A: How do you want to test, whether a model can forecast the future return distribution well? Using models
likelihood function seems not a very good idea, because likelihood depends on the model. And, I would like to 
compare different models, so the measure of model quality should be independent of the model construction. 

So can I measure the quality of probability measure forecast in a model-independent way?



* What are your selection criteria?
* What is your baseline model?

We have some hyperparameters! (Estimator decay factors)
