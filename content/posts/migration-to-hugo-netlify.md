title: Notes on migrating this blog to Hugo and Netlify
date: 2018-10-03 16:33:56 +0000

Written mainly for my own record.

This blog is a static website generated using [Hugo](gohugo.io). The sources are hosted on GitHub and the website is compiled and served by static website hosting service Netlify. I can also use forestry.io to edit the content. Forestry can access the GitHub repo and commit content on my behalf. The domain name is unfortunately still with my old provider.

* Git repository hosted on GitHub: (https://github.com/jwergieluk/wergieluk-com)

Netlify monitors that repo and recompiles the site each time it sees a new commit.

## DNS configuration

Unfortunately, my domain name provider (Domain Factory) doesn't support domain name flattening. I ended up implementing the  setup described here: [https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/#dns-configuration](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/#dns-configuration "https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/#dns-configuration")

The www subdomain points to my primary domain at Netlify while an "A" DNS entry is used to point the APEX domain to Netlify's load balancerâ€™s IP address. This is apparently not ideal.

    wergieluk.com	A	104.198.14.52
    www.wergieluk.com	CNAME	agitated-hodgkin-44.netlify.com

## Take awaits

* Netlify has some very nice documentation: [https://www.netlify.com/docs/](https://www.netlify.com/docs/ "https://www.netlify.com/docs/")
* Apparently it's better to use the good old www subdomain as the root: [https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/28/to-www-or-not-www/](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/28/to-www-or-not-www/ "https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/28/to-www-or-not-www/")

## Todos

* Read Hugo docs
* Play around with forestry.io
