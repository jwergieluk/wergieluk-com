I made this small (~5cm high) sculpture after watching some 
[YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWmSmXWsWpM) 
showing the Post Void indie game. I really like the esthetics used in this game. Also, the idea of running around with 
the head detached from the body closely resembles the human condition most of the time.

Shooting decent photos of small objects using a smartphone camera can be quite difficult.
