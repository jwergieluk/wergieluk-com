Simple window managers


Switching to a tiling window manager is like realizing that you have been
sitting on a spike ball for all those years. The key idea is to move the window
handles of open apps to a place where they can be accessed in the quickes
possible way. The window handles sit in the short term memory of users brain. I
know that my webbrowser sits on workspace 9, because it has been there for
years. When I want to browse internet, my own brain gives me the pointer. I
therefore do not need a "taskbar" with all the distracting icons to tell me
about all the windows floating round.

Also, using a simple window manager without all the icons is so liberating.

Some ofter encountered myths about tiling window managers: 

* You need to memorize a ton of keyboard compinations to use a tWM. 
* The configuration is tidious and time-consuming. 


TWMs have not only low memory footprint but, more importantly, have low congnitive load requirements. 



Standard key combinations of i3 I use:

* 'Super-Enter' opens a terminal
* 'Super-Q' closes a window
* 'Super-E' and 'Super-W' activate tiling and stacked window modes, resp.
* 'Super-1' to 'Super-9' activate the relevant workspace.
* 'Super-*-Arrow' move windows around.
* 'Super-Shift-5' sends a window to the workspace 5.
